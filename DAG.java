 * By definition, a DAG has no back edges (paths from a
 * descendant to an ancestor), so nodes should not have a
 * reference to their parent; parents, however, can have
 * multiple child nodes, so these are stored in an ArrayList
 * due to the in-built function of ArrayLists (see class structure
 * of the Node class). The edge stack will be used to pop and push
 * nodes to keep track of parent nodes in a traversal. Once a node
 * has no children, this node is popped onto the fOrderStack which,
 * after fully populated, can be popped until empty, effectively reversing
 * the finishing order of the DAG's traversal, which gives us a topologically
 * sorted DAG. That's what my notes say, at least :D
